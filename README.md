# 🚀 Learning React + TypeScript Journey

Welcome to my React learning journey! This repository is where I document everything I’m learning — from the basics of React to using TypeScript, and finally building small real-world projects.

## 🧭 Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Learn React (using Vite + Yarn)
Focus: Get comfortable with React core concepts using plain JavaScript.

## 🧠 Notes & Learnings

I'll be adding my notes, challenges, and what I’ve learned along the way inside separate folders or markdown files.


# Day 1
-Set up React using Vite using this "yarn create vite "filename" --templates=react | ts
-Set up PORT and add dotenv in file Note! in the .env the name PORT=3000 it must no whitespace
# Dat 2
-creating components and folder structure for layout [rootLayout,adminLayout]
-add react-router-dom for navbar and use Navlink and useLocation for static dropdown &custom css for active link

## 🚧 Work in Progress...

This is a living document, and I’ll keep updating it as I grow as a React + TypeScript developer!

Thanks for checking it out!
